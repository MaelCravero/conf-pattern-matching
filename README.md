# How to do bad pattern-matching in C++

This repository contains the slides and code examples for my talk at the `Nuit
de l'Info 2021` hosted by [GConfs](gconfs.fr) on C++ pattern-matching in [Tiger
Compiler](https://assignments.lrde.epita.fr) using `std::variant` and
`std::visit` and its (easily reachable) limits.

A recording can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THGk7lFHgNQ) (in
french).
